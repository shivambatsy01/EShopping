To run the application, Locally or remote, this application have dependency on MongoDB instance.
Now one way is either run the MongoDB instance locally and then update the configuration of the application to connect it to that instance,
Else update the docker files so that while running this application in container, It starts everything into the container.

So basically, Containerise everything.
So create docker image of MongoDB, first run that image in local container and then run application natively.
